# dotfiles

My dotfiles!

Attempting to keep it simple while working with both \*nix and cygwin shells. 
* Sets term and vim themes to solarized. 
* Along with a few status line submodules for zsh and vim.
* Adds DejaVuSansMono font. https://github.com/powerline/fonts

## First use:
    * Run these commands:
        ~~1. $ chsh -s $(which zsh)~~ (Globally set in bashrc.)
        2. $ cd ~/dotfiles && git submodule init && git submodule update

## Required:
        On Windows, install DejaVuSansMono from ./fonts 
        or DejaVuSansMono from powerline/fonts.git

## TODO:
    ~~* Add fonts to dotfiles?~~
