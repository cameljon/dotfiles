# dotfiles

My dotfiles!

Attempting to keep it simple and make these work with both *nix and cygwin shells. 
Sets term and vim themes to solarized. Along with a few status line submodules for zsh and vim.

## First use:
    * Run these commands:
        1. $> chsh -s $(which zsh)
        2. $> cd ~/dotfiles && git submodule init && git submodule update
## Required:
        DejaVuSansMono from powerline/fonts.git
## TODO:
    * Add fonts to dotfiles?
